  - Has a built-in command line interface called vanella to help you get started with your    project!
  - It has a built-in create, read, update, delete api functionality.
  - It uses oAuth2 for client app authentication.
  - It uses JWT for generating access token.
  - You can create your own custom api call right off the bat using your favorite vanilla php or object oriented style of coding or via VANELLA command line interface !
  - You can also add additional libraries via composer depending on your needs.
